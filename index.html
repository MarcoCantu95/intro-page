          <h3>Manufacturing Engineering</h3>
          <p>I started as an industrial engineer because I've always been a very logical and critical thinker. I was in charge of the introduction of new products from prototype stage all the way to mass productio, and also getting the final approval from our customers with APQP and PPAP process.</p>

          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>I've always thought that my critical and logical way of thinking is very helpful in a coding environment as I am able to identify failures and solve issues with ease, so this year I decided to start my coding journey in order to transition my career to a more It oriented one. I started learning python and some HTML and CSS for web development.</p>

          <h3>Twitch Streaming</h3>
          <p>I love videogames! I've played a lot of them since I was a child and on my free time I like streaming on twitch. I play videogames such as League of Legends and World of Warcraft. Right now I am not currently streaming because I'm focusing most of my free time on my coding journey but feel free to follow me and catch me live soon!</p>
